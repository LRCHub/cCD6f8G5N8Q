Straight from the factory
We were made for each other
One of those things that's meant to be
Straight from the factory
Nothin' less than exactly
You're the only lock that's made to fit my key

Many parts an' many hearts
Been mismatched before
Still, they make delivery
Some folks send 'em back
An' never find what they need
But babe, my satisfaction's guaranteed

Straight from the factory
We were made for each other
One of those things that's meant to be
Straight from the factory
Nothin' less than exactly
You're the only lock that's made to fit my key

Straight from the factory
We were made for each other
One of those things that's meant to be
Straight from the factory
Nothin' less than exactly
You're the only lock that's made to fit my key

Sittin' tight an' sittin' proud
Waitin' on a shove
Passers by just keep on passin' by
I'll admit, I did a bit of passin' by myself
'Til I found a perfect fit
An' now I'm tied

Straight from the factory
We were made for each other
A perfect match as anyone can see
Straight from the factory
Nothin' less than exactly
You're the only lock that's made to fit my key

You're the only lock made to fit my key
