It is cold but it is warm
It is one but not alone
There is beauty in the beast
It is endless; it is home

Listen to the promise calling me
Can you hear the song of the factory
Can you hear the song of the factory

Always moving, never leaving
It is words beyond meaning
You can feel it if you try
It has rhythm without seeming

Listen to the promise calling me
Can you hear the song of the factory
Listen to the promise inside me
Can you hear the song of the factory
Can you hear the song of the factory

Listen to the promise calling me
Can you hear the song of the factory
Listen to the promise inside me
Can you hear the song of the factory

Can you hear the song of the factory
Can you hear the song of the factory
